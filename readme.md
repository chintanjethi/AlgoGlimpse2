## :v: General

### :wave: Introduction

AlgoGlimpse<span>.</span>com is an online algorithm visualization tool written using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and d3.js.

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Algorithms

At the time of writing this readme, I've implemented visualizations for 24 algorithms in 3 categories and 4 data structures.

The 3 categories are:

- sorting
- graphs
- pathfinding and maze generation

## :technologist: Technical stuff

### :rocket: Behind the visualizations

I've made the visualizations using d3.js. All visualizations are contained in an \<svg> and are essentially just manipulations of svg elements. As this is the first time I've used d3.js, there's probably a lot of room for improvement in my code.
